OpenPawl orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents toward your goals — with memory, learning, and structure that persists across sessions.

---

## The Problem

Vibe coding alone is a grind. Every session starts from scratch:

```
Before OpenPawl:                    After OpenPawl:
───────────────────────────────     ──────────────────────────────
Prompt into the void            →   Persistent team memory
Re-explain context every time   →   Instant session briefing
Make decisions alone            →   Structured debate + review
Forget why you chose X          →   Decision journal
Repeat the same mistakes        →   Global lessons learned
Ship things you're unsure of    →   Confidence-gated delivery
No structure                    →   Sprint cadence with standup
```

OpenPawl replaces that friction with a team that remembers, learns, and holds itself accountable.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codepawl/openpawl/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 20, bun, and an LLM API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, or local Ollama).

---

## Quickstart

```bash
openpawl setup                    # guided setup wizard
openpawl                          # launch interactive TUI
openpawl standup                  # daily summary
openpawl think "SSE or WebSocket?" # rubber duck mode
```

The bare `openpawl` command launches the interactive TUI with chat, sprint, and collab modes. For unattended runs:

```bash
openpawl run --headless --goal "Build auth" --mode sprint --runs 2
```

---

## Features

### Three Execution Modes

| Mode | How it works | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Solo** | Single agent responds to prompts with tool calling | Quick tasks, chat, exploration |
| **Collab** | Multi-agent chain (e.g. coder → reviewer → coder) | Code review, architecture, debugging |
| **Sprint** | Planner breaks goal into tasks → parallel execution → post-mortem | Full features, multi-file changes |

Switch modes with `Shift+Tab` in the TUI or `--mode` in headless.

### Team Orchestration

7 built-in agents (coder, reviewer, planner, tester, debugger, researcher, assistant) collaborate via native API tool calling. The planner decomposes goals into tasks, workers execute in parallel, and a post-mortem loop extracts lessons for future runs. Agents use keyword-based routing and confidence-gated delivery.

Team composition is flexible: pick agents manually, let the system compose autonomously based on your goal, or use one of 5 built-in templates. Custom agents can be created and configured via `/agents` in the TUI. Agent profiles track performance across runs.

### Memory and Learning

The team remembers across sessions. Success patterns get stored in LanceDB — future runs retrieve what worked. Failures feed a post-mortem loop so mistakes don't repeat. Every architectural decision is logged in a searchable decision journal. Hebbian memory strengthens associations between concepts based on co-activation.

### Developer Tools

- **Session briefing** — "previously on OpenPawl" context every time you start
- **Daily standup** — what was done, what's blocked, what's next
- **Rubber duck mode** — structured debate from multiple perspectives
- **Drift detection** — flags when a new goal contradicts past decisions
- **Goal clarity checker** — challenges vague goals before planning begins
- **Context handoff** — auto-generates CONTEXT.md at session end
- **Inline diffs** — colored unified diffs on file writes/edits in TUI and headless
- **Post-mortem learning** — extracts lessons across runs, injects into future planning

### Terminal UI

- **Rich TUI** — keyboard navigation, Catppuccin Mocha theme, mouse support
- **Escape to cancel** — stop any streaming response mid-flight
- **Token counter** — live input/output token tracking in the status bar
- **Type-to-filter** — filter in all list views (agents, templates, sessions)
- **Centralized keybindings** — view and customize via `/hotkeys`
- **Min terminal size handling** — graceful degradation on small terminals
- **Context compression** — automatic compaction keeps context growth < 1x

### Observability and Control

- **Audit trail** — full decision log exported as markdown
- **Replay mode** — re-run any past session for debugging
- **Agent heatmap** — find utilization bottlenecks across runs
- **Cost forecasting** — estimate cost before a run starts
- **Performance profiler** — opt-in timing breakdown of the full pipeline
- **Headless mode** — `openpawl run --headless` with `--mode`, `--template`, `--workdir`, `--runs`
- **Provider/model sync** — single source of truth across agents and modes

---

## Team Templates

Pre-built teams you can install and use immediately:

```bash
openpawl templates browse                          # list available templates
openpawl templates install indie-hacker             # install a template
openpawl run --headless --template indie-hacker \
  --goal "Build auth system"                        # use in headless mode
```

Or use `/team` in the TUI to browse and switch templates interactively.

| Template | Pipeline |
|----------|----------|
| `content-creator` | Research, Script, SEO, Review |
| `indie-hacker` | Architect, Engineer, QA, RFC |
| `research-intelligence` | Research, Verify, Synthesize |
| `business-ops` | Process, Automate, Document |
| `full-stack-sprint` | Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Lead |

Five seed templates ship offline. Community templates at [openpawl-templates](https://github.com/codepawl/openpawl-templates).

## Architecture

    U[User Prompt] --> R[Prompt Router]

    R -->|solo| A1[Single Agent + Tools]
    R -->|collab| CC[Agent Chain]
    R -->|sprint| SP[Sprint Planner]

    A1 --> LLM[LLM Multi-Turn Loop]
    CC --> LLM

    SP --> T1[Task 1]
    SP --> T2[Task 2]
    SP --> T3[Task N]

    T1 --> LLM
    T2 --> LLM
    T3 --> LLM

    LLM --> TC[Tool Calls]
    TC -->|file_write/edit| DIFF[Inline Diff]
    TC -->|shell_exec| SH[Shell]
    TC -->|web_search| WS[Web]

    LLM --> PM[Post-Mortem]
    PM --> MS[(Memory Store)]
    MS -->|next run| SP
```

Three execution modes share a common LLM multi-turn loop with native tool calling. Sprint mode parallelizes independent tasks. Post-mortem extracts lessons into LanceDB vector memory for future runs. Context compression keeps long conversations within token limits.

bun run dev          # watch mode
bun run build        # production build (tsup + web client)
bun run typecheck    # type-check (tsc --noEmit)
bun run test         # run tests (bun test)
bun run lint         # lint (eslint src/)

## Security

- Config at `~/.openpawl/config.json` may contain API tokens
- Agent output is untrusted — review before applying to production
- Global memory at `~/.openpawl/memory/global.db` — back it up

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.
