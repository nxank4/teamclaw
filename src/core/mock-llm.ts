Modular architecture with clear boundaries between components.

2. **Service Layer** — Business logic encapsulation
3. **Data Layer** — LanceDB for persistence

## Data Flow
Client → API → Service → Data → Response

Ensures quality and allows early feedback.

## Detailed Design
Phase 1: Core scaffolding
Phase 2: Feature implementation
Phase 3: Testing and polish

## Alternatives Considered
- Big-bang approach (rejected: higher risk)
- External service (rejected: adds dependency)

From an engineering standpoint, I'd recommend the following approach:

**Architecture**: Use a modular design with clear interfaces between components. This allows independent testing and future extensibility.

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Clean separation, testable, maintainable
- Cons: Slightly more initial setup time

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk — this follows patterns we've successfully used before.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with the modular approach. The upfront cost is minimal and the maintainability benefits are significant.`;

Looking at this from a specification standpoint:

**Requirements Analysis**: The requirements are clear and well-defined. No ambiguity detected.

**Specification Gaps**: None identified — the scope is well-bounded.

**Standards Compliance**: The proposed approach aligns with industry best practices.

**Documentation Impact**: Minimal — existing docs cover the patterns being used.

**Recommendation**: The proposal is sound. I suggest adding a brief ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for future reference.`;
